Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Deducto! Please follow these guidelines to keep the project healthy and approachable.

- Fork the repo and create feature branches (branch name prefix: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`).
- Write clear commit messages and open pull requests against `main`.
- Add tests for new logic and run `./gradlew check` in the Android module.
- Before merging, ensure PR has at least one approval and green CI checks.
- If you introduce new secrets or service accounts, add instructions to `docs/SECURITY.md` and never commit secrets to source control.

If in doubt, open an issue to discuss larger changes before implementing them.
